        <h1> ABOUT ME...</h1>
        <img alt="Image of Me?" src="images/mea_and_sisters_small.jpg">
        <p>My name is Cathy and I am from Payson, Utah (MST zone.) The picture I included is of me and two of my sisters. I am on the far left!</p>
        <p>I have been a student at BYU-I since 2018. Being a mom of 5 kids and a wife of 22 years, I have had to move a lot slower through my degree. With that being said, I am hoping to graduate with my bachelor’s degree in a couple more years! WAHOO!!</p>
        <p>I am pursuing a degree in Professional Studies with an emphasis in office management and communications. I have loved my time at BYU-I and can say that without a doubt, it has changed me as a person for the better.</p>
        <p>I love to spend time outside in the dirt. Planting and tending to a garden and then preserving the food that we grow. I love to play the piano, bake, cook, spend time with my family, camp, and I love to make people laugh. </p>
        <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints all my life and I feel very blessed to have a relationship with my Savior, Jesus Christ. With that being said, I can get caught up in the challenges and regrets of life and feel like I don’t measure up. It is for this reason, I love the quote by Jeffrey R. Holland that says, “Be peaceful. Believe in God and yourself. You are doing better than you think you are.” When we are trying our best to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ and repenting of the mistakes we make, we are met where we are by Jesus Christ with grace, love, support, and hope. I love Him and I am grateful to be attending a college where I can speak freely of my devotion to our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>I look forward to learning with all of you this semester! I do not feel confident in coding at all but I am excited to learn and I feel confident that we all will receive support in this process we move through together. Joy!</p>
