As a mom of five kids, I know what it takes to create something that will please the masses and it brings me great joy in providing for others. After eating my treats, I want you to feel like you just got a big hug from your own Mama.</p>

      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
      <p>Do you deliver?</p>
      <p>Yes! I deliver from Juab County to Salt Lake County and anywhere in between.</p>
      <p>What is your delivery fee?</p>
      <p>From Orem to Spanish Fork, delivery is free. If your location is outside these areas, the delivery fee is based off distance from Orem. I do waive the delivery fee if the order total is more than $150.</p>
      <p>Can I purchase items individually?</p>
      <p>Because I am a small bakery and all items are baked fresh to order, I do require that orders be made in increments of one dozen. This applies to all the varieties of cookies I offer.</p>
      <p>Your food looks so yummy but I live out of state. Do you ship your products to the customer?</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, I do not. There is just no way to ensure freshness and that the cookies would arrive intact. Mama cannot have that!  I do hope to in the future but as of right now, I only sell local to my area.</p>
      <p>I want to place an order but I don't see any pricing. What are your prices?</p>
      <p>As a reminder, orders must be in increments of one dozen. The price per dozen is $18.</p>
      <p>How big are your cookies?</p>
      <p>Great question! It can be hard to tell how big they are just from a picture. They are approximately 4" in diameter. </p>
      <p>How can I contact you for more information or to place an order?</p>
      <p>You can find my contact information in the graphic below. I look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
