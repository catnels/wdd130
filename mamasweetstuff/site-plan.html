      <h3>About Mama</h3>
      <p>My name is Cathy and I am the Mama that bakes all the yummy goodness. One of my most favorite things about baking treats for you is that I get to know you! I love meeting new people and building good friendships with them. In fact, I already consider you my friend!</p>
      <p>I run my business in a cute little town in Utah. For 30 years, I have been honing my baking skills so I can build treats with perfection for you! As a mom of five kids, I know what it takes to create something that will please the masses and it brings me great joy in providing for others. After eating my treats, I want you to feel like you just got a big hug from your own Mama.</p>
      <p>Creating homestyle cookies is my jam. I create food for large and small groups alike. Catering and special orders are right up my alley. I look forward to making friends with you through your stomach!</p>

      <h3>FAQ's</h3>
      <p>Do you deliver?</p>
      <p>Yes! I deliver from Juab County and Salt Lake County and anywhere in between.</p>
      <p>What is your delivery fee?</p>
      <p>From Orem to Spanish Fork, delivery is free. If your location is outside these areas, the delivery fee is based off distance from Orem. I do waive the delivery fee if the order total is more than $150.</p>
      <p>Can I purchased items individually?</p>
      <p>Because I am a small bakery and all items are baked fresh to order, I do require that orders be made in increments of one dozen. This applies to all the varieties of cookies I offer.</p>
      <p>Your food looks so yummy. Do you ship?</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, I do not. There is just no way to ensure freshness and that the cookies would arrive intact. Mama can’t have that!  I do hope to in the future but as of right now, I only sell local to my area.</p>
      <p>How can I contact you for more information or to place an order?</p>
      <p>You can find my contact information in the graphic below. I look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
